# Quick GitHub Repository Creation Instructions

Since automated creation requires authentication, please follow these quick steps:

## Option 1: Create via Browser (Recommended - 1 minute)
1. Open https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `UniEngage-backend`
3. Description: `Backend for UniEngage - Student Participation Management System`
4. Select: **Public**
5. **Uncheck** all initialization options (README, .gitignore, license)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

## Option 2: If repository already exists
If you've already created it, just let me know and I'll push the code!

## What I've Done
✅ Initialized git in backend folder
✅ Created .gitignore
✅ Committed all backend code
✅ Set remote origin to: `https://github.com/yashwanthyashu514/UniEngage-backend.git`

## What's Next
Once the repository is created on GitHub, I will:
1. Push the backend code
2. Connect to Render
3. Deploy the service
4. Configure environment variables
5. Provide you with the live service URL
